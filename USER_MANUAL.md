Accountability is the heart of Pay & Promise.

- **Submit Proof**: Every day, you MUST submit a **photo proof** of your activity to mark it as "Done". 
- **Camera Only**: To ensure authenticity, you can only use the in-app camera to take a live photo. No gallery uploads allowed!
- **Missed a Day?**: If you fail to check in, you can mark the day as "Failed". **Warning**: This triggers an instant penalty deducted from your stake.

You are also the judge! 
- **Review Peers**: Check the activity feed in your promise details.
- **Vote**: Verify your friends' submissions by voting **Confirm** or **Reject**.
